# Demo1:__url
# cant get __url from parent class

# Demo2:get method when inheriting from more parent
# find from left to right

# Demo3:__init__ acts like normal methods, is not the constructing method
# You should use super().__init__ to call parent's __init__ method in __init__

# loop importing module
# import the module just above the called line instead of the beginning
